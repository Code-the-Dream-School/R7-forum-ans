Questions for Lesson 6

1. When you enable CRUD operations on a table in the database, you need to add four things
to your Rails application.  When you generate a scaffold, all four are created.What are they?




2. When you specify a route in config/routes.rb, you need to include certain information.  What
must be included? In addition, you may specify an additional parameter to create a variable
that describes the route.  How do you do that? What variable is created?



3. What does the Rails db:migrate command do?



4. What file do you look at to see the current database schema?


5. What command shows the routes?


6. How can you start the Rails console? How can you do CRUD operations from the console?


7. What statements are in erb files that make them different from html files?  What are the
two kinds of special statements, and how are they marked in the erb file? Where are they executed?


8. Consider this statement: @forum = Forum.new().  Why is Forum capitalized?  Why is @forum not
capitalized? Why is the @ used?



9. Consider these statements:

@forum = Forum.new(...)
@forum =Forum.create(...)
@forum.save(...)

What is the difference between Forum.new() and Forum.create()?  Why can't you do Forum.save(...)?


10. In the forums controller, you have a method called show:

  def show
  end

This is an action method.  It is an action method for only one reason: There is a route
that points to it.  But there's nothing in the method!  It will do the right things
because the default behavior does what is needed.  What does the default behavior
do?  How does it know which forum to show?  Whenever you have an action method, there
is a hash called params that is passed to that method.  And, in this case, the params
hash has a value, params[:id].  What is the value for this element of the hash? How
did it get there?
